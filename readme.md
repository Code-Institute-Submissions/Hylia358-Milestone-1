Code Institute - User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

This Is a Fitness Centre Website to present to new and old customers. The website highlights several areas a customer would be interested in for example:
- Memberships
- Images to do with the Fitness Centre
- About Us page containing the address, opening times and social links
- offers

# UX

## User stories
As a Customer, I expect to see a detailed list of what memberships are offered, how much they will cost and what I will get out of it.

As a PT Instructor, I expect to know what I have to help the customers with based on their membership tier whether it be swimming lessons, yoga or workout regimes.

## Strategy
I wanted to make this site very minimalistic and show only what was needed to get a message across, while also making it easy to use and very user-friendly.

## Scope
For Customers, I wanted to provide them with a detailed overview of our membership tiers, what each tier will provide in benefits, also for them to get a glimpse at people working out at the gym from the pictures and so they understand where we are located and what time they can access the gym.

## Structure
In the Memberships page, I wanted them to be able to quickly see each of the paid memberships that are offered, a summary of what they offer in benefits. In the About Us page I wanted them to have the information needed to find us, Know when we are open for business and have links to our social platforms to stay updated on news.
