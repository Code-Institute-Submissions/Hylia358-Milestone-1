# UX

### User stories
As a Customer, I expect to see a detailed list of what memberships are offered, how much they will cost and what I will get out of it.

As a PT Instructor, I expect to know what I have to help the customers with based on their membership tier whether it be swimming lessons, yoga or workout regimes.

### Strategy
I wanted to make this site very minimalistic and show only what was needed to get a message across, while also making it easy to use and very user-friendly.

### Scope
For Customers, I wanted to provide them with a detailed overview of our membership tiers, what each tier will provide in benefits, also for them to get a glimpse at people working out at the gym from the pictures and so they understand where we are located and what time they can access the gym.

### Structure
In the Memberships page, I wanted them to be able to quickly see each of the paid memberships that are offered, a summary of what they offer in benefits. In the About Us page I wanted them to have the information needed to find us, Know when we are open for business and have links to our social platforms to stay updated on news.

# Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z ... For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement Another feature idea Technologies Used In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

# JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation. Testing In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

# Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)? Different configuration files? Separate git branch? In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
